<h1 align="center">PyScript</h1>

Python introduce a new things which I explored today and that is ***`PyScript`*** . This may be tricky on first time but ***`PyScript's`*** team organized so well, anyone can explore it by self and use it very easily and adopt so quickly, I think this new tech is awesome for those who only wants to stay in  **`Python env`** they will definitely gonna love this. I like to share my thoughts on this new technology from ***`Python.org`*** , I must say these will be the future.

Let's talk about its features and tags, How to use in projects. I would say this may only for small projects, not preferable for major project because it still have some issues like lagging, data transferring, some syntax errors, etc.

***

## Feature 1️⃣ :-
We can easily type python's code directly into **`HTML`** file like we add **`JS`** and start code into it. 

**NOTE** :- First you have to add two lines before starting a code you can add between **`Head tag`**

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
```

#### ***Syntax*** :-

Add this line between **`Body Tag`**

    ```
        <py-script>
            print("Hello Python")
        </py-script>

    ```
